\section[Project Organization]{Project Organization\textsuperscript{[TDJ]}}
At the start of project we conducted a few meetings in order to visualize and
plan the tasks at hand. A draft of the system architecture was created which in
turn was used to delegate tasks between the groups. Parts of this draft was
later revised based on feedback we received as well as realizations made down
the line.\\\\
The team was structured into task-oriented groups in the following manner:\\
\noindent
{\tabulinesep=1.4mm
\begin{tabu}{ll}
\textbf{STM32} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Jerker Ersare\\
   Thorsteinn D. J{\"o}rundsson\end{tabular}\\
\textbf{Decision Maker, Overtaking and Parking} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}
   Niklas Le Comte\\ Marco Trifance\end{tabular}\\
\textbf{Proxy and Serial} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Jonas Kahler\\

\textbf{Image Processing and Lane Following} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}
   Max Enelund\\ Dennis Karlberg\end{tabular}
\end{tabu}}
\\\\
As the project progressed and tasks were completed, group members participated
in other efforts where applicable and as needed. Among those, Jerker aided in
lane-following, Ivo conducted unit tests and Jonas created a configuration tool
used in development and vehicle testing.

\section{Milestones and Successfully Completed Tasks}
We always delivered on time except the sensor recording diagram (April 12), due
to problems with hardware. We received a new ultrasonic sensor the day before
the presentation and did not manage to make recordings and diagrams in time.\\\\
